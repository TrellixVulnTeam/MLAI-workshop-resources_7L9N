    "## An Introduction to Linear Learner\n",

    "Welcome to our example introducing Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner Algorithm!  Today, we use the Boston Housing dataset, present in Scikit-Learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we'll use is a linear regression model.  Linear models are supervised learning algorithms used for solving either classification or regression problems.  As input, the model is given labeled examples ( **`x`**, `y`). **`x`** is a high dimensional vector and `y` is a numeric label.  Since we are doing regression, the algorithm expects the label to be be continuous values.  The algorithm learns a linear function, mapping the vector **`x`** to an approximation of the label `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner algorithm extends upon typical linear models by training many models in parallel, in a computationally efficient manner.  Each model has a different set of hyperparameters, and then the algorithm finds the set that optimizes a specific criteria. This can provide substantially more accurate models than typical linear algorithms at the same, or lower, cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on.\n",

There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.  The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."

You can create experiments to organize all your model development work for: A) a business use case you are addressing (e.g. create experiment named “Boston House Price prediction”), or B) a data science team that owns the experiment (e.g. create experiment named “house price analytics experiment”), or C) a specific data science and ML project. Think of it as a “folder” for organizing your “files”."
